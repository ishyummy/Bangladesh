Dear Sir, 
As per your instruction and review, we did change and updated the UX of the ANTT Robotics Management level. Here I have attached 04 (four) different pdf of 04 users. You may also need the Division, District, and Area names for the address dropdown menu, so I attached another pdf (Division-District-Upazila.pdf) for your reference.

I will also send you the UX flow using Figma by today. 

Thank you so much for your kind advice, hope we will build the business addressable solution under your guidance.
